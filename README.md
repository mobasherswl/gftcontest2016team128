This project was developed for a competition the details of which can found on the URL provided at the end of this file. It was a team effort lead by me and the first commit called "baseline code" is the code that was developed and submitted. As a team lead and team member I put in a lot efforts but even after submission I had few ideas I wanted to play with so I created this repo for the purpose.
